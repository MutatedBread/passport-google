# passport-google

An effort to learn nodejs with google authentication through passport package, credential storage via redis and express static serving.

I used passport, passport-google-oauth, redis, connect-redis, express-session and etc.

To use this nodejs server :
1. Install redis and run redis-server.
2. Just go to project root and run `node server.js`
3. I attached a demo google client key and secret for this for the moment, please don't abuse.

I will add documentation one day.

You can try to understand the code by yourself for the moment.
